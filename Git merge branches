KodeKloud Enginer Task

The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/beta.git. 
This repo is cloned at /user/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. 
They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:
a. Create a new branch devops in /user/src/kodekloudrepos/beta repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (on storage server itself). 
b. Add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch to the master branch. 
c. Finally, push the changes to origin for both of the branches.


[root@ststor01 beta]# history
   cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta
   git checkout -b devops
   cp -v /tmp/index.html .
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Added index.html"
   git checkout master
   git merge devops
   git push origin master devops
